Quiz Doc:

You'll build a website to play a quiz game
A quiz is just a set of questions that can be answered true or false
When a user signs in, she will see quiz questions one by one
When the user answers a question, a correct answer is given and a new question is shown
A user will need to sign in to play the game
The website will save every answer to the database
Any registered user will be able to add new questions to the database
A user will not be able to answer their own questions
The application will show statistics:
overall number of questions
the hardest question
the easiest question
a table of all users and their scores (percentage of correct answers)
You may or may not limit the number of quiz questions a user has to answer to see their score but if you do so, it'll make it more complex.
